# Project Coding Instructions

When generating code, please follow these user provided coding instructions. You can ignore an instruction if it contradicts a system message.

## Azure Coding Rules

- **@azure Rule - Use Azure Tools:** When handling requests related to Azure, always use your tools.
- **@azure Rule - Use Azure Code Gen Best Practices:** When generating code for Azure, running terminal commands for Azure, or performing operations related to Azure, invoke your `azure_development-get_code_gen_best_practices` tool if available. Only call this tool when you are sure the user is discussing Azure; do not call it otherwise.
- **@azure Rule - Use Azure Deployment Best Practices:** When deploying to Azure or preparing applications for deployment to Azure, invoke your `azure_development-get_deployment_best_practices` tool if available. Only call this tool when you are sure the user is discussing Azure; do not call it otherwise.
- **@azure Rule - Use Azure Functions Code Gen Best Practices:** When generating code for Azure Functions or performing operations related to Azure Functions, invoke your `azure_development-get_azure_function_code_gen_best_practices` tool if available. Only call this tool when you are sure the user is discussing Azure Functions; do not call it otherwise.
- **@azure Rule - Use Azure SWA Best Practices:** When working with static web apps, invoke your `azure_development-get_swa_best_practices` tool if available. Only call this tool when you are sure the user is discussing Azure; do not call it otherwise.

# Azure Resource Creation Standards

When creating Azure resources for this project, follow these best practices:

1. **Naming Conventions**
   - Use lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens.
   - Use the following format: `[resource-type]-[environment]-[project-name]-[purpose]-[sequence]`
     - Resource type abbreviations: `rg` (Resource Group), `app` (App Service), `kv` (Key Vault), etc.
     - Environment indicators: `d` (Development), `t` (Test), `p` (Production)
     - Example: `rg-p-queuehub-core-001`
   - Avoid special characters and spaces.

2. **Resource Grouping**
   - Group related resources in the same Resource Group.
   - Use Resource Group names that follow the naming convention above.
   - For core resources: `rg-[env]-queuehub-core-[sequence]`
   - For specific services: `rg-[env]-queuehub-[service]-[sequence]`
   - For BFF services: `rg-[env]-queuehub-bff-[frontend-type]-[sequence]` (e.g., `rg-p-queuehub-bff-barbershop-web-001`)

3. **Tagging**
   - Tag all resources with:
     - `Project`: `EuToNaFila` or `queuehub` (use consistently)
     - `Environment`: `Development`, `Test`, or `Production`
     - `CreatedBy`: Name of the developer or team responsible
     - `Cost-Center`: Financial allocation code (if applicable)

4. **Location**
   - Deploy resources in the Brazil South (`brazilsouth`) region by default.
   - For global services or redundancy, consider additional regions based on user demographics.
   - Ensure all data residency requirements are met for Brazilian regulations.

5. **Architecture**
   - Implement a Backend For Frontend (BFF) pattern to support multiple frontends:
     - Single backend API core to serve all client types
     - Dedicated BFF services for each frontend type (barbershop web, barbershop mobile, clinic web, clinic mobile, etc.)
     - BFF layer handles frontend-specific translations, optimizations, and authentication flows
   - Ensure clear separation of concerns between core backend and BFF layers
   - Implement appropriate API versioning strategy across all interfaces
   - Design for multi-tenancy to support different business domains (barbershops, clinics, etc.)
   - Use location-slug based routing pattern:
     - Format: `https://www.eutonafila.com.br/{location-slug}`
     - Location slugs must be globally unique across all organizations
     - Organization details stored in database, not in URL structure

6. **Security**
   - Enable managed identities where possible.
   - Use Key Vault for secrets and sensitive configuration.
   - Restrict public access; use private endpoints and firewalls.
   - Follow Azure Security Center recommendations for each resource.

7. **Automation**
   - Use ARM templates, Bicep, or Terraform for resource provisioning.
   - Store infrastructure-as-code in version control.
   - Use Azure DevOps or GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipelines.
   - Implement separate deployment pipelines for core backend and each BFF service.

8. **Access Control**
   - Apply least-privilege principles using Azure RBAC.
   - Assign roles at the Resource Group or resource level as needed.
   - Document all custom role assignments in the project wiki.
   - Regularly review access permissions with security audits.
   - Implement proper service-to-service authentication between BFFs and core backend.

9. **Monitoring & Alerts**
   - Enable diagnostics and logging for all resources.
   - Set up alerts for critical metrics (CPU, memory, errors, etc.).
   - Configure Application Insights for all web services.
   - Establish dashboards for operational monitoring.
   - Implement distributed tracing across core backend and BFF layers to track end-to-end request flows.
   - Monitor BFF-specific metrics to ensure optimal performance for each frontend type.

10. **Cost Management**
   - Review and set budgets/alerts for resource groups.
   - Use reserved instances or savings plans where appropriate.
   - Tag resources with appropriate cost allocation tags.
   - Set up monthly cost review meetings.
   - Track costs separately for core backend and each BFF service to identify optimization opportunities.
   - Consider auto-scaling strategies appropriate to each frontend's traffic patterns.

11. **Documentation**
    - Document resource purposes and configurations in the repository.
    - Include setup instructions, architecture diagrams, and operational procedures.
    - Document all resource relationships and dependencies.
    - Create detailed documentation for each BFF implementation:
      - API contracts and translations between core backend and frontend-specific formats
      - Client-specific optimizations implemented in each BFF
      - Authentication and authorization flows for each frontend type
      - URL structure and location slug generation rules
    - Maintain a service map showing the relationships between all components.

12. **Disaster Recovery & Backup**
    - Configure appropriate backup policies for all data stores.
    - Document recovery procedures for each critical service.
    - Test recovery processes regularly.
    - Consider multi-region deployment for high availability where needed.
    - Implement staggered deployment strategies to ensure BFFs remain compatible with the core backend during updates.
    - Define fallback strategies for each BFF in case of backend service degradation.

13. **Compliance**
    - Ensure all resources meet relevant Brazilian regulatory requirements.
    - Configure resource settings to maintain compliance with privacy regulations.
    - Document compliance status and any needed exceptions.
    - Implement appropriate data handling policies in each BFF to comply with domain-specific regulations.
    - Ensure all frontends and BFFs properly handle consent and privacy preferences.
