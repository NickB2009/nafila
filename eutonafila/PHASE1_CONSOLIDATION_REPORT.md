# Phase 1 Completion Report: Domain Services Consolidation

## Completed Tasks

### Wait Time Calculator Service
- ✅ Created canonical implementation in `domain/services/wait_time_calculator.py`
- ✅ Updated references in:
  - `domain/services.py` - Removed duplicate implementation and imported canonical version
  - `domain/domain_models.py` - Removed duplicate implementation and imported canonical version
  - `barbershop/models.py` - Updated import to use canonical version
  - `application/services.py` - Updated import to use canonical version

### Queue Service
- ✅ Refactored to use canonical `WaitTimeCalculator`
- ✅ Fixed the implementation to use the same algorithm as the canonical version

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Single Source of Truth**: All wait time calculations now come from one authoritative implementation
2. **Consistent Behavior**: No more subtle differences in calculation logic
3. **Improved Maintainability**: Future changes only need to be made in one place
4. **Better Testability**: Tests can focus on a single implementation

## Implementation Details

### Original Problem
The `WaitTimeCalculator` service was implemented in multiple places with slight variations:
- `domain/services.py` - Used floating point division and had a different format for hours
- `domain/domain_models.py` - Used integer division and had a specific "Sem espera" message
- In `QueueService.calculate_wait_time()` - Had custom calculation logic

### Solution
Created a consolidated implementation in `domain/services/wait_time_calculator.py` that:
- Uses integer division for consistency
- Includes the "Sem espera" message for zero wait time
- Has proper formatting for both hour and minute representations
- Properly handles edge cases like zero barbers

## Next Steps

With Phase 1 complete, we can move on to Phase 2 of the migration plan:
- Repository Interface Consolidation
- Moving interfaces from application to domain layer
- Standardizing repository implementations

All changes were made with backward compatibility in mind, ensuring no functionality was broken in the process.
